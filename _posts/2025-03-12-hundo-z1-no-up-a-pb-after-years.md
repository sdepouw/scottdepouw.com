I decided I wanted to play a different category in *The Legend of Zelda* - 100% No Up+A. The "No Up+A" means the same thing here as it does in its Any% counterpart (cannot press Up+A on the second controller to get to the `CONTINUE / SAVE / RETRY` menu, can't death warp). The 100% part is what you'd assume: Collect everything! (Well, *almost* everything).

You do collect the item (the food/bait) that's missing in this menu, but you use it during the run. And the SRC rules do not require you to re-collect it. You also don't buy the Magical Shield, or any potions. Everything else you have to claim, though!

The run went rather well, for what was essentially a de-rust. I haven't run this category too much, but it's been a few years since I've attempted it... and I've gotten a lot better since then. It showed here! There's plenty to improve on (as always), but I'm very happy with this run.

I improved my time by nearly two minutes, lowering it to `37:46.600`! Visiting the [SRC leaderboard](https://www.speedrun.com/the_legend_of_zelda?h=100_No_UpA-First_Quest&x=wkpo9g2r-gnxwmd48.xqkyow4l), this will improve my ranking from 32nd place to 21st!

This run was streamed earlier today on [my Twitch stream](https://twitch.tv/TheDoctorBlue), and is available to watch on YouTube:

I want to run this category back (alongside doing more attempts at the main category), but I've been hankering for other games too. We'll see where I go next!
