3/17/2009

On March 17th 2009 I purchased the domain `scottdepouw.com`, fully intending on making it my personal slice of the web. While it hasn't quite been 84 years, it's been almost 16! It was something I just procrastinated on over and over.

But now I've finally gotten around to making a web site! Whipping up a quick blog post to test the waters, try features, and make sure everything's working as intended.

## What to Expect

I'll be posting about personal software development projects, speedrunning, and whatever else I feel like writing about!

> In speedrunning communities, I'm known as `TheDoctorBlue`. It's a name that has no meaning (I am not a doctor, nor am I blue) that I came
> up with on the spot one day. You can find any speedrunning content by me under that alias!

Thanks for reading!
