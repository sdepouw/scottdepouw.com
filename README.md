The repository of my personal web site! It's a [Jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/).

[Visit live site here!](https://scottdepouw.com/)

Runs Ruby, so I have it checked out into a Docker container (dev contianer in VS Code).

### Run Locally

Will run out of `http://localhost:4000

```powershell
bundle exec jekyll s  
```
